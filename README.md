# Learning React FE and BE

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Learning from a freeCodeCamp tutorial: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/>

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.

This file was first created using the Yeoman generator [`generator-hchiam-learning`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-hchiam-learning).
